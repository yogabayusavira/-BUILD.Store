/**
 * About Us — purpose, the cooperative model, and where we're going.
 *
 * This page exists at the seam between $BUILD.Store and the wider Future
 * Modern parent (the eventual `afuturemodern.com` marketing site, captured
 * in roadmap Phase 3 / 0.12). Until that parent site exists, /about lives
 * here — close enough to the product surface that prospective members can
 * read the cooperative principles right before they apply.
 *
 * Tone (revised 2026-04-25): debonair, driven, people-powered. We don't
 * fabricate; the resumes speak for themselves. None of our clients came
 * from freelance platforms — anything visible there is a testament to
 * who we are, not a credential. Voice draws from the Future Modern Brand
 * Marketing Strategy: Purpose, Vision, Provenance / Discernment / Equity,
 * tagline "Rare∞."

              The phrase is honest about where we came from. Patrons

              around it were historically lazy: no point-of-sale
              discipline, contracts that read like favors, profit
              conversations that did not happen until the money was
              already gone. We kept the underlying idea and fixed the
              controls. We stopped pretending the labor was not equity.

              The failure mode of pooled labor is not the people who
