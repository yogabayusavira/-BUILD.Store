/**
 * A single signed-agreement record. One row = one signature event

 * revised covenant, that is a NEW row (the prior row stays for the
 * historical record). This is the primitive gates read against when
 * they need to answer "does this member have a current, valid
 * signature on `talent_data`?"
 *
 * Storage:
 *  - The actual signed artifact lives outside the DB — either at
 *    the provider (Adobe Sign / DocuSign) or in the repo under
 *    `Future Modern/deliverables/legal/signed-agreements/` using
 *    the ISO-date naming pattern established for Rob Turley's LOI.
 *  - `storageUrl` is the pointer. For provider-hosted agreements,
 *    it can be a deep link into the provider console; for filed
 *    PDFs, it's the repo-relative path.
 *  - `externalRef` is the provider-native identifier (envelope ID,
 *    agreement ID) when applicable, otherwise null.
 *
 * OG onboarding path:
 *  - An on-chain $BUILD holder MAY exist with no matching Agreement
 *    row here. That is not a violation — it means an original
 *    contributor from before the registry existed. The admin
 *    Agreements surface flags these ("unmatched holder → OG
 *    onboarding needed") so the cooperative can reach out, get them
 *    caught up on current paperwork (talent_data + membership
 *    covenant at minimum), and formalize the relationship. Do NOT
 *    treat missing agreement as forfeited standing for pre-registry
 *    holders — it's an onboarding backlog signal, not a compliance
 *    failure.
