/**
 * /admin/compliance — SOC 2 + ISO 27001 control status dashboard.
 *
 * Every control we've decided to care about maps to one row. Each row
 * carries: the framework citation, the control text, current sandbox
 * state, the production remediation, and a pointer to on-platform
 * evidence (audit log link, code path, or policy doc).
 *
 * This is a read model, not authoritative — the readiness audit doc at
 * deliverables/compliance/soc2-iso27001-readiness.md is the canonical
 * long-form. This surface exists so admins can see the shape at a
 * glance without leaving the app.
