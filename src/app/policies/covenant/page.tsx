          <p className="mt-2">
            $BUILD.Store is a shared professional infrastructure owned
            and operated by its Members. It exists to make it possible
            to do serious, well-compensated creative and technical work
            without surrendering the upside to an employer, a
            marketplace platform, or a private-equity aggregator. The
            Covenant is the shared operating agreement that keeps the
            cooperative worth belonging to.

            Governance principle: flat governance, hierarchical relationships
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            Every Member has one voice in governance. Relationships
            inside project teams and client engagements are hierarchical
            when the work requires it — someone owns delivery, someone
            owns account, someone owns direction — but that hierarchy is
            confined to the engagement. Governance is not for sale, and
            leadership on one project confers no permanent authority
            over another.

            Every active Member carries an OVR (0-99) computed from
            seven sub-ratings: quality, outcomes, reliability, hustle,
            collaboration, attendance, referrals + BD. Twelve-month
            rolling window, weighted to recent work. Provisional new
            Members do not carry a public OVR until they cross the
            promotion threshold (roughly three completed engagements +
            two peer reviews received).

            Compliance ladder — the penalty mechanic
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            Covenant violations produce compliance penalties. Each
            penalty is -9 OVR for 90 days, stacking. The math is
            deliberate: three penalties inside 90 days moves a
            middle-band Member into probation; four moves them toward
            removal. Real-time impact prevents the pattern where a
            Member&apos;s slow decline is only recognized after a year
            of accumulated damage.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            Penalties are admin-recorded with an arbitration record —
            the reason text is preserved in the immutable audit log.
            Rescission by admin is possible and itself audit-logged. A
            Member facing a penalty they believe is mistaken can invoke
            the cooperative arbitration process; the formal Arbitration
            Procedure document lands with the production LLC operating-
            agreement rewrite (see{" "}
            <code>production-swap-checklist.md</code> §9).

            invent standing that nobody earned through the system. This
