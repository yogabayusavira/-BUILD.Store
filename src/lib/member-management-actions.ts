/**
 * Admin member management actions.

 * the /admin/access-review surface handles the quarterly ritual; this

 *
 * Every action here writes to `users`. They mutated an in-memory
 * fixture until 2026-08-31, which meant tier changes, admin grants,
 * profile visibility and — worst — suspensions all reverted on the
 * next deploy. A suspended member came back with access, and the
 * audit log said they were still suspended.
 * with row-level security enforcing the actor's admin scope.

/**
 * Admin recognises a member as an artist, or takes it back.

 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY (2026-09-22)
 *
 * There was no way to do this. `profileMode` only ever moved inside
 * `publishEpk`, and the nav only shows the EPK editor once
 * `profileMode === "epk"`, so the entry point appeared only after an
 * admin published an EPK the member had no way to reach the editor to
 * build. Nobody could become an artist, which is why nobody in the
 * beta had an EPK.
 *
 * Artist status is admin-granted on purpose. It is recognition, not a
 * checkbox: it changes how the member is named in public and opens the
 * press-kit rail. Members ask; you decide.
 *
 * TWO THINGS MOVE TOGETHER
 *
 * Artist status controls the alias (publicName honours displayName only
 * in EPK mode) and the EPK rail. Turning it off returns the member to
 * the first-name convention immediately and pulls a published EPK off
 * /u/[handle], because that page requires both EPK mode and a
 * published kit. The EPK row itself is untouched, so flipping the
 * status back restores it as it was.

/**
 * Admin permanently deletes an account. No undo.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL (2026-09-04)
 *
 * It deliberately did not until now. Suspension was the answer to
 * every "remove this person" and mostly still is: it blocks sign-in,
 * hides the profile, and keeps the record, which is what the
 * business-records policy wants.
 *
 * What suspension does not do is remove the row. Jamar had a second
 * viewer account for himself and it was inflating the onboarded count,
 * so the record being retained was the problem rather than the point.
 * Suspending a duplicate does not make it stop being counted.
 *
 * WHY IT IS THIS NARROW
 *
 * The delete has to be safe for the case it was not written for: an
 * admin on the wrong row. So it only fires for an account carrying
 * nothing worth keeping, and "nothing worth keeping" is decided by
 * getMemberFootprint, the same function the page uses to decide whether
 * to render the button. One definition, two callers, so the control and
 * the guard cannot drift.
 *
 * THE PRECONDITIONS, AND WHY EACH ONE
 *
 *  - Not yourself. Same reason you cannot suspend yourself.
 *  - Not an admin. Revoke the flag first, exactly like suspend, so
 *    removing a peer admin takes two deliberate acts.
 *  - Already suspended. This is the real ratchet. Deleting is the
 *    second half of a decision, never the first thing you do to an
 *    account, and a suspended account is already locked out so nobody
 *    is mid-session when the row goes.
 *  - Type the email. The uid is in a hidden field and every row on
 *    /admin/members looks alike. Typing the address is the step that
 *    makes the wrong row impossible rather than unlikely.
 *  - A reason, recorded. The audit entry outlives the user row.
 *
 * WHAT POSTGRES STILL CATCHES
 *
 * Around forty foreign keys to users.id have no onDelete clause, so
 * they refuse the delete rather than cascade. That is a better guard
 * than this function because it cannot fall out of step with the
 * schema. A violation here is not a bug, it is the schema saying the
 * account was not empty after all, so it gets translated into that
 * sentence instead of a 500.
