/**
 * Annual member canonizations — year-end snapshots minted as ERC-721
 * NFTs with ERC-6551 token-bound accounts. See `future-modern.md`
 * "Annual canonization" section for the principle.
 *
 * ============================================================
 * SANDBOX ILLUSTRATION ONLY — DO NOT MIGRATE TO PRODUCTION.
 * ============================================================
 *
 * The 2025 entries below are seeded so the UI surfaces have cards to
 * render during development. They are NOT cooperative canon. Production
 * launches with **zero canonizations on file**; the first real run
 * happens at the end of the cooperative's first full calendar year of
 * operation (likely Dec 31 of the launch year). Awarding retroactive
 * tier-cards based on present-day judgment about contributions made
 * before the MVP Score system existed would invent standing that
 * nobody actually earned through the system, and would undermine the
 * authenticity of every future card.
 *
 * **Production-swap step:** wipe MOCK_CANONIZATIONS contents (empty
 * array) before deploying. The cooperative canon starts at zero.
