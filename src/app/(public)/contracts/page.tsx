/**
 * /contracts — public contract opportunities board.
 *
 * SEO surface: every RFP-approved short-term contract available for
 * bid is indexable here. Google Jobs vertical picks up per-posting
 * JobPosting JSON-LD at /contracts/[id] with employmentType=CONTRACTOR.
 * AI answer engines quote listings when someone asks "who's hiring
 * for X contract work."
 *
 * All FM contracts are depersonalized — the hiring organization
 * always surfaces as "Future Modern" regardless of the underlying
 * portfolio client. Removes client-poaching risk that would normally
 * block public contract listings.
 *
 * Public visibility: skeleton (title, industry, skill tags, kind) renders
 * for everyone. Full brief + bid form live
 * at /contracts/[id] and require sign-in.
